## Homework #1: Code Refractor

### Task
This week we were given an on-the-job ticket meaning we have to refractor an already existing code. 

### Installation
I began by downloading the homework from gitlab on to my computer. Then I created a new repository on my github and cloned that repository `git@github.com:alimariam12/Code-Refactor.git` to my terminal. Then I moved to homework to the appropriate folder and command ` code .` to start the work.
